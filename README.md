# Deep Learning Python Coursework

## Context

This is a coursework assignment that I completed as part of my Deep Learning module in my MSc Artificial Intelligence. The requirements of the coursework as well as my code and answers are all in the Jupyter notebook <em>convolutional_neural_networks.ipynb</em>. My contribution consisted in completing the parts of the code between `START OF YOUR CODE` and `END OF YOUR CODE` as well as the `ResNet` and `ResidualBlock` classes.
The aim of the coursework was to explore various deep learning functionalities through implementing a number of pytorch neural network layers from scratch and creating my own deep learning model and methodology for a high dimensional classification problem.
